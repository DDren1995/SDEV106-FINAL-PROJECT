        <p><b>Hey, there!</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            My name is Deric Drennan.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm an undergraduate student at Green River Community College in the Data Analytics and Software Development program. I intend pursue employment in the tech industry for the forseeable future.
            <br>
            <br>
            I attended public school in Grant County, then traveled here to King County to get my GED and college degree.
            <br>
            <br>
            After I finish my Associate's Degree, I will continue into the Bachelor's Degree program, and from there I would like to begin searching for employment in software development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope to be hired to build and maintain computer hardware like servers and custom desktops for private companies.

        <p>This is where the second body paragraph of the Bio page is supposed to go, but I don't have anything else to say. Hoping for the best.</p>
